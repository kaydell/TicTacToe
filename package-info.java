 * The code in this package implements the game, Tic-Tac-Toe in a console user-interface.
 * 
 * The main() method in the class Series can be called to play a series of one or more games.
 * 
 * Please give me feedback or ask for help at the JavaHelpline:

 * 
 * Exercises:
 * 
 * 1.  Run the program a few times
 * 
 * 2.  Step through the program a few times, using your source-level debugger to look inside the program while it is running
 * 
 * 3.  Add a bit of randomness to the evaluations of moves so that the ComputerPlayer doesn't always make the same moves.
 * 
 * 4.  Change the SIZE of the board.
 *   a. Change the value of the constant Board.SIZE
 *   b. You'll also have to change the threeInARow() method and the methods that it calls to be more general, using loops.
 *   
 * 5.  Add unit-tests to the code.
 *   a. For each Java file, create a Java file to test the first Java file with.  For example, to test Board.java, you need to
 *      create BoardTest.java, etc.
 *      
 * 6. Make a more complicated two-player strategy game such as Connect-Four, Checkers, or Chess. (This would take some time.)
